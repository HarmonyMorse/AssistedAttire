 ### **_Description_**

 Assisted Attire was created as the Capstone project in the last weeks of General Assembly's [Software Engineering Bootcamp](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive) from Feb 6, 2024 to Feb 16, 2024.

 Assisted Attire is the ultimate virtual wardrobe and outfit planning application, specifically engineered to address the unique challenges faced by neurodivergent individuals who experience the "out of sight, out of mind" phenomenon with their clothing. This full-stack web application is designed to make clothing management seamless, enabling users to easily organize their fashion collections, monitor the condition of their garments, and unlock a world of outfit combinations with ease.

 The inspiration behind this project stems from my own experiences with clothing forgetfulness, a common issue among those of us who are neurodivergent. Recognizing the potential to aid not just myself but others facing similar difficulties, I decided to create Assisted Attire. The application is the result of a deep-seated passion for utilizing technology to create useful products, all while prioritizing functionality and style. Assisted Attire is meticulously designed to alleviate the stress of decision-making in wardrobe management, ensuring that every piece of clothing is remembered and utilized to its fullest potential.
